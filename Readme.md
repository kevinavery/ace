Ace (Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor)
============================

This is a fork of the popular [Ace Editor](http://ace.ajax.org/) which I modified to use on [my website](http://kevin.avery.io).

The primary modification was to allow for embedding links in the text using Ace's code folding. For example, if you want a sentence containing a link to `https://github.com` called `Github's the best`, you can type:

```
    Don't you think that [https://github.com Github's the best]??
```
